review/summary: Good Quality Dog Food
review/text: I have bought several of the Vitality canned dog food products and have found them all to be of good quality. The product looks more like a stew than a processed meat and it smells better. My Labrador is finicky and she appreciates this product better than  most.

review/summary: "Delight" says it all
review/text: This is a confection that has been around a few centuries.  It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts. And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered sugar.  And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven.  Not too chewy, and very flavorful.  I highly recommend this yummy treat.  If you are familiar with the story of C.S. Lewis' "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch.

review/summary: Nice Taffy
review/text: I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag. The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc. My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites). Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks! I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat.

review/summary: Best of the Instant Oatmeals
review/text: McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it. There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation.  Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal. It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried.  All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good.  It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue.<br /><br />McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product.  Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff. One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners.  Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum. But this is a convenience product.  Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey.

review/text: This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand.  It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you.  Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats.  The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too.  Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart.

review/summary: Oatmeal For Oatmeal Lovers
review/text: McCann's makes oatmeal for every oatmeal connoisseur, whether one likes it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour, to the sloth addled instant, which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes. It's all good, that's for sure, and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different flavors as well as regular.<br />  This variety pack allows different tastes to be explored, as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between McCann's and other well-known oatmeals. What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America. The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add. In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use.<br />  The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes. This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal.

review/summary: Hearty Oatmeal
review/text: This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor either.  It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again.

review/summary: You'll go nuts over Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.
review/text: This wasn't in stock the last time I looked. I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts. They are hot. They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms. It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run. They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work. I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg. I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return.<br /><br />The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed. It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes.<br /><br />You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas. He'll be so insulted.

review/summary: Hammer Nutrition 's Fizz Rocks!
review/text: I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form.  Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides.  Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powder.  Now we have the Fizz...what a great product!  Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products. Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz.  Third it tastes great! Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a "salty" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango!  The camelbaks always get the Fizz now.  I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes. I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough.

review/text: For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The "zero carb" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work.....

I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried.  The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted.  It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take.

review/text: Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!

review/summary: Warning!  WARNING!  -ALCOHOL SUGARS!
review/text: Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read "maltitol" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!

review/summary: Forget Molecular Gastronomy - this stuff rockes a coffee creamer!
review/text: I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off.  I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth.  I use it to make my own coffee creamer.<br /><br />I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured "food" items.  I really don't think they are good for the body.  On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee.<br /><br />I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creamer.  I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powder. The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee.  You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich. Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own. I like mixing 1/3 of each together.<br /><br />For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) sugar.  I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers.  If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead.  I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars. I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom.  Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though.<br /><br />This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors.  I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix.<br /><br />All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online.  Take the time to experiment.  Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk. Or don't add any flavorings.  It is up to you.  Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts.<br /><br />I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great.

She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice.. she seems to like that better. We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it. If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue.. or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it! You will see a difference in your pet.

review/summary: Great Dog Food!
review/text: My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met.  After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance.  What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties.  I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it.  Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not.  I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells...<br /><br />Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans.  I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon.<br /><br />All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food.  While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it.

review/text: I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.

review/summary: Great dog food
review/text: My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food. He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this year. Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full. On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day. When you take this into account, you're actually getting more "bang for your buck" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods... and a healthier, happier dog, to boot! Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime... I'm sold!!

review/summary: Perfect for our English Bulldog with Allergies
review/text: My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3.  The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind.  This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since.  It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef).

I came home with about a dozen items. That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus. Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus. This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good! It's the best I can recall. There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating. I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says "only 60 calories per jar!" Now this is my idea of a good diet food!<br /><br />Gary Peterson

review/summary: My every day green tea
review/text: I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now.  I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping.  For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night.  But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me.  I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together.  I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit.  I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits.  Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold water.  In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas.  This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh.  I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y.S. Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too.  I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it).<br /><br />Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped.  The one shipped displays "NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays "CAFFENE FREE".  So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not.  The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag. So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it.

review/summary: So Far So Good
review/text: I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively. The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc... in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too. The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it. He is a posh cat after all. He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food. Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy. Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal? Is that right? I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned.<br /><br />I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats. I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them. Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it. Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy. She's tiny, but happy and agile. I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one. I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it.

My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft. Mainly, he loved the taste even more!

She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price.  It aids in digestion since the...ok sorry...smells are gone if ya know what I mean.

review/text: Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food. I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food. I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats. The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova. Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble. I began looking for a replacement. After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat. For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select. It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters.

review/text: I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste. Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavor.  I don't find this to be the case with this soup. Any flavor is killed off by the burn.

review/summary: Great value and convenient ramen
review/text: Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors. These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal. This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale.

review/text: I love this flavor of ramen! I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison. For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store.

It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it!  I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)

review/text: I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size.  If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all.  The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience.  As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same.

review/text: Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!

review/text: The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little "stuffing" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found "none" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF "STUFF" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S.

This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really "takes the cake" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!

This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going. It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong. The stronger it is the less you use as well. The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost. I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad.

After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place.<br /><br />Love this stuff.

review/summary: Great product to help you sleep
review/text: WE have been looking for "natural" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule. Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice. This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep. I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me. After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed! I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus.<br /><br />I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best. The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss! The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box. Big packing fail, but the product is awesome.

review/summary: Perfect for gluten-free chocolate chip cookies
review/text: We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic!  The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned.  Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs.  The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flour.  And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lower.<br /><br />I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it.

review/summary: Make a fresh fruit tart, light and beautiful
review/text: This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts. I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something "strawberry" should be offered. You can make the most amazing and relatively "healthy" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets. They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through. I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place. Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit. To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan. Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform. You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake. Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake.<br /><br />I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms. You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crumb.) Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze. Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best.<br /><br />If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf. The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base.

review/summary: A huge hit at the office!
review/text: I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to. Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet. When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin! One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes. Like I said, theyre a real hit. Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch! I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart?) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with).

review/text: To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints. They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes. The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis. I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath. Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes. At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints.

review/text: we have fed our cats a lot of stuff. These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters. They loved the Purina. They loved the Nutro. They loved the Iams. They love whatever we feed them.<br /><br />This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love. After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties. We tried a few types of food. Some evinced no change. Some made the litter super-stink.  Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it...<br /><br />This Felidae has done the trick. No problems to speak of. It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose. The cats love it. The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing. And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved. Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food. We're now loyal Felidae consumers.<br /><br />Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies.

review/text: I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it. She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament. I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food! She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat. I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something. In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae. I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it. Clearly, mine does.

review/summary: Great For Fat Cats and Senior Citizens
review/text: We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient.  That is what the vet told us ten years ago.  The youngest is a blob.  When he lays down, he looks like a footstool. The other two are arthritic and skinny.<br /><br />Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats.  I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems.<br /><br />Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats.  However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really "feeling better" since we changed their food to Felidae.  Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep.<br /><br />I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective.<br /><br />However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life.

review/summary: CHANGED FORMULA MAKES CATS SICK!!!!
review/text: As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula.  Cats do not like change when it comes to their food.  And they just had to change it without putting it on their label.  We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell.  (As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues.)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home.  If cats get "upset" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating.  It depends on the cat.  Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight.  We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal.  It has been a year since then and they are better.  Then the formula for this food changed.<br /><br />We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us.  We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food.  It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick.  Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have.<br /><br />Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating.  Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it!  We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula.<br /><br />I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal.  As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it.  This is just horrible!

review/summary: More Hot/Spicy than McCormick's Brand
review/text: My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us. It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it. It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat. We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix. I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is.<br /><br />If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind. To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it. You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes. In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste. I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil.<br /><br />I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more.

review/summary: Ahmad Loose Imperial Blend Tea is great for the price
review/text: A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago. Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound. At $7/lb. in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great. I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc. Most of them were over $30/lb. with shipping. Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest. Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring. My current favorite afternoon tea. Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it.

review/summary: Nice tea
review/text: I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging. So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill. And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i.e. iced vs. hot, this tea is excellent in both forms. I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg.

review/summary: A fragrant tea
review/text: I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma.<br /><br />The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store.  One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma.  So the label "Imperial Blend" kind of implied the herb.<br /><br />I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too.  I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature water.  But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea.

review/summary: Best Ahmad Tea
review/text: I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea. Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across.  The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried. It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot. I enjoy it best in the evening. It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day.<br /><br />For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication.

review/text: I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced.  I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly. My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too.

The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess. I made it with snow peas and carrots only. I dont like the little corn.  Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice.  It came out wonderful! Dinner on the table in less than 30mins.

review/summary: Taste is neutral, quantity is DECEITFUL!
review/text: The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste.<br /><br />What was a HUGE disappointment? How misleading the packaging of the box is. The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box). Wrong! The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads.<br /><br />What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. FAIL! They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers. Not ecofriendly at all.<br /><br />Would I buy these again? No - I feel ripped off. The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavor.

I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods.  My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON.com.

review/summary: High Quality... But it gave my dog wicked gas..
review/text: The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned. This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home.<br /><br />Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before. Never have I seen such gas issues. Both of them consistently had foul gas. Consistently. Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know. They're dogs.<br /><br />When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon. It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco. But, they continued to have gas. I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food. Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony.<br /><br />Eventually, we switched their food. No more farting. I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies. They just need that in their diet. I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year). Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long. Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow. Much better. Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot better.

review/text: I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box.  I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes.<br />This tea, however, is nothing of the sort. Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless.  Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore. So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse.

review/summary: If you can't handle caffeine, this is not for you.
review/text: Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!

review/summary: Great for Gluten-free lifestyle!!
review/text: Had this shipped to my sister who follows a gluten-free eating plan and she reports that it is very versatile and easier than grinding almonds for a crispy crust on chicken and fish filets. Also uses it in place of bread crumbs in meatloaf and meatballs.  Stays moist when added in place of wheat flour in baking, too. Good product, good value.

review/summary: Manufacturing Problems Diminish Product
review/text: I have used and liked Sugar in the Raw for many years, after being introduced to it in a Starbucks. My most recent purchase, however, was disappointing. The sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe 1/4th of the regular size. Having large crystals was something I always really liked about Sugar in the Raw. It enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of lattes. I called their hotline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar. They have had many complaints of a similar nature. This, they claimed, also reduced the crystal size. They said this problem should go away with their newer crop. The representative said that the new-crop sugar will have a 6-10 digit date code (without ANY spaces) that ends with a "1" and no letters. The trailing digits are a date code using the Julian calendar. (My recent bad-purchase had a space after the initial sequence of numbers and then ended with a "51A"). Bottom line: their current product is not much better than much cheaper products. When they get a better crop, I'll go back to purchasing Sugar in the Raw.

review/summary: Lie!!!!
review/text: I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice.

review/summary: Excellent but not perfect
review/text: This is a delicious sugar. It has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma. But the granules are quite big, however -- bigger than plain refined sugar. This makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together. But if you use it in a recipe where you will melt the sugar first before baking it, or if you use it to brew beer and plan to boil it to melt it, it is a great product. It would be the perfect sugar if only the granules were a bit finer.

review/text: Can't say anything bad about Sugar in the Raw.  I like it better than the other "natural" sugars. Better consistency and - I know it doesn't matter - but better color. Unfortunately, one of the "natural" paper bags got torn a bit in the box.  It didn't look like the box was damaged so I can't tell how it happened, but it was sort of pain to clean up half a bag that spilled all over the inside of the box and our kitchen when I opened it.  Not sure what the solution is and I'd order it again, but if it happens again, I'd switch to one of the brands that ship in an unnatural plastic bag.

review/text: Please ignore the one-star comments, if you check the bag the main ingredient IS in fact whole grain brown rice and the second is rice flower. With anything that is gluten free you have to add another "binder" which is where the corn flour comes in. For someone who has celiac disease and cannot have Sunchips, because they contain wheat (a key binder to any chip, cookie or cereal) this is an excellent product. My spouse and I buy these a lot because they are gluten free and absolutely delicious!

review/text: I paid $1.79 for a 2 ounce pkg of these at lunch today. I bought them because brown rice is a "good" carb.  As soon as I tasted one and it tasted like a corn chip I checked the ingredients.  The name is deceptive - these have "Masa corn flour" listed in the ingredients and it overwhelms the taste.  I won't buy these again - I can get Sunchips for less money and similar taste.

review/summary: Rotel saves me on a daily basis
review/text: I use the Rotel Mild and I LOVE this product so much--it saves me on a daily basis.  If you're trying to cook lower fat, healthier foods and in a HURRY, this stuff makes it so much easier.  Ever notice that some canned tomatos have a weird "tin can" taste when you make spagehetti sauce or whatever?  For some reason this product doesn't have that.  It tastes so good you can just dump it in with a can of beans, heat and eat.<br /><br />or add some chili powder and now you have chili soup.  I also make indian dishes with this, and spicey spaghetti sauce.  I also prefer this to most canned salsas, so it works for things like quesadillas if you drain the liquid off.<br /><br />None of my local grocery stores carry it at all, nor do they carry anything like it.  So I have to pay Amazon's inflated price to order this by the case.  I don't like that I'm paying a higher price, but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the product.

(In Texas I was called a "baby-mouth" - not into very spicy-hot foods.)<br /><br />For comparison, I'm comfortable with Tostitos medium chunky salsa. 1 can of this milder Rotel, mixed with 2 slightly larger cans of diced tomatoes, was still way too hot for me to use as salsa for chips. I used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornbread that was good though.

review/summary: Great Natural Energy
review/text: This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.

And the price is ok, on Amazon anyway. At my grocery store they were almost $3 each, yike!<br /><br />And it's organic--so I can feel good about it, right? It's all about me feeling good!

review/text: I had tried both of the Guayaki energy shots and I don't like the taste of either of them! This one has more natural caffeine and tastes much better. I like them cold for sure. My husband and I take these on road trips in a little cooler with ice and waters and we don't have to make stops for coffee! Especially on the turnpikes where it's just way too expensive. It's worth the $[...] per shot. We normally split them. I'm really sensitive to caffeine, even the natural kind so I get a little weird if I drink the whole thing but that's the same for coffee too for me. My husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost. I would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there. You can feel good about putting this in your body! I'll be ordering again soon for sure =)

So, I asked the nice lady at the counter of my local Whole Foods Market, for something that will give me that extra energy I need to get through the day.<br /><br />She excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle. Over three hours after drinking whatever that was, my brain is still working at unnatural speeds. To summarize my experiences: I believe this works.<br /><br />She did explain that I needed to drink plenty of water with it, which I personally feel helped the energy level. So if you're feeling tired during the day and hate coffee, give this a shot - preferably before you eat anything.<br /><br />Woot!

review/summary: Best energy shot I have ever tasted!
review/text: I first found Steaz Berry Energy Shots at a local organic market. I bought two bottles, which cost just under three dollars each. I fell in love instantly. The drink is delicious -- I can taste the yerba mate and the acai juice, like a slightly bitter fruity chocolate honey tea. I am very sensitive to sucralose (Splenda) which is in so many energy drinks these days; I also hate the taste. I love that Steaz has actual sugar and no artificial sweeteners. The rush it gives me is slow and even. I have several medical conditions, including fibromyalgia, which saps me of energy and causes intense pain. I like how Steaz helps clear away the fatigue and fog so I can get things done. No caffeine jitters, even though there are 150 mg of caffeine in each bottle.<br />It was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores, so I started looking online for a bulk price. I am so thrilled to have found the Pack Of 12 on Amazon. I signed up for Amazon Prime specifically for this product, hah!

review/text: Products takes pretty good, and it doesn't leave you gittery.  With subscibe and save as well as Prime membership I pay below $ 2 a shot.  My wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style.  I moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training.  I recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a healthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an AWESOME Energy Drink.

review/summary: Flavor getting better, energy is great
review/text: I've been buying and drinking this for over a year now, and the energy boost is excellent, with a continuous, ~6-hour effect. The most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well, or perhaps I'm getting more used to it. I don't drink it for the flavor, but it's not as heinous as the fake flavors found in the other, non-organic energy shots.

review/text: This is the first time I've really been misled by other reviews on amazon. I like 5-hr Energy, I find Rain ok and so I thought I'd try this product based on the reviews. Boy am I sorry! I gagged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched (really). And it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards. 8 tic tacs at once did not get rid of it! But worst of all, within an hour I was yawning and drowsy. Unless you really like things that taste of a weird tea-flavored cough syrup and don't work, don't buy this! I don't know what to do with the other 11 bottles. big fail

review/text: Try this you might like it. I did and I am quite addicted, it is too easy to prepare, it tastes great and it absorbs the flavors you cook it with. The price is really good and well worth the purchase. If you like this type of Couscous like I do, then give this one a try.It can be eaten hot, room temp or in a cold salad with a variety of greens and other flavors, it takes on the other flavors very well when mixed. I cooked the Couscous with a broth and oilive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time. I will be back for more.

review/text: I love ordering whole bean coffee on Amazon.  I like this so much that this my first product review.  I have to say that I'm usually not a big fan of flavored coffee, but I thought I would give it a try.  When my husband started grinding it up, I could smell it throughout the house.  Sometimes with flavored coffees, the smell is there but the taste isn't.  However, not with this one.  I'm now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try.

review/text: This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it.

review/summary: Hot and delicious
review/text: I consume about a jar every two weeks of this, either adding it to fajitas or using it as a corn chip dip.  It is hot, but after awhile the medium Salsa Suprema was too mild for me; I thought maybe I'd cut down how much I ate by going to the hot Salsa Ranchera.  It's hot enough that people who aren't used to it will say "That's hot!".<br /><br />Flavor: bright and forward.  The similarly hot Salsa Victoria is a duller taste to me, I guess earthy.  This salsa is much brighter in the mouth.  I don't like to go hotter than this because the sauces I've tried lose any resemblance to yummy salsa and just taste hot (this happens to me with Tabasco sauce, for example).<br /><br />A drawback is La Victoria doesn't make a larger bottle of Salsa Ranchera nor Salsa Victoria, nor do they sell them in [...] or Sam's Club.  To get a good deal you have to watch for sales.

review/text: These creamers come in 4 packs of 25. I have taken one to work and opened one for home so far, and haven't found a single broken or leaking creamer yet. I usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee, but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because I won't allow myself more than 2 creamers per cup. I think this is definitely the best option for buying creamers from Amazon since all the other listings have a lot of complaints about creamers breaking in shipping!

review/summary: Better Packaging
review/text: Besides the obvious convenience and portability of the individual creamers, I liked this item specifically because of packaging. I couldn't believe how many reviews I read about coffee creamer cups; but many of the Amazon creamer options (both Coffeemate and International Delight) had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to sloppy packaging.<br /><br />That was not an issue here. The shipment arrived in four dispensing boxes of 50 each (as shown in the photo); those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes. Thus, none of my cups were broken, no waste and no sloppy drippy mess. Plus the four boxes means I could put one in the kitchen, one in the bathroom (we moved our mini Keurig there when we upgraded the kitchen Keurig - best idea my husband ever had), and one at work, with a reserve for whichever runs out first.<br /><br />If you are looking for these mini creamers but deterred like I was by the negative packaging reviews on other options, this is your best bet. As a bonus, the auto delivery price is very reasonable.

review/text: I have a slightly different version of this - different brand.  My son started using it around six months, and he really enjoys it.  He DOES get messy if he eats something sticky or juicy like banana or watermelon, but whatever...  Anyway, I also had trouble cleaning it, until I tried scrubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush.  That works pretty well.  It takes some time, but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or blender, or cut it up, then clean it up off him, the chair, the floor, the dog, me, well you get the picture.

The only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the mesh and the seams and are impossible to get out.  Granted, some foods are more difficult than others and some don't cause that much of a problem.  Bananas however, have pretty much destroyed a couple of them.  While I love this product, I think that next time I will get the one that has the removable and replaceable mesh bags.
